Features of PACT
Powerful Customization
PACT offers you customization feature as never seen before in any accounting software.
Customization of data entry screens or adding or removing of columns from the reports falls under
basic customization. We do not treat this as a main feature. The power of customization comes from
the fact that every data entry screen can be customized and linked to financial accounting or stock
valuation or both.
PACT provides customization in reports in a unique way. You may sort and define matrix layout for
every report apart from the normal customization like adding/removing/changing width of the
columns.
Classification of Accounts
PACT offers classification of accounts in tree format with the option to add/edit/move accounts from
one group to another and the grouping itself can be done up to 7 levels. The accounts tree can be
truncated to view only the groups or specified levels or the full chart of accounts. Moving of accounts
from one level to another is never so easy with the drag and drop facility. The chart of accounts follows
automatic code structure pre-defined by you. If you choose not to use codes, codeless accounts tree
can be defined.
Masking of Data Entry

field to be printed on the invoice/voucher. Print your invoices/vouchers on pre-printed computer
stationery or on plain paper with your logo in bitmap attached on plain paper.

,"Al Rabie , exit 5 King Abdul Aziz Road, Riyadh, Saudi ArabiaView Map",Networking,Siva,"Hi,

Greetings from CALLEM. A brief introduction about our self and the business proposal that we bring in to add value to your organization.

The term SMALL & MEDIUM BUSINESS (SMB) is used in the European Union and other international organizations to designate small to medium enterprises -- companies that have a limited, specified number of employees is based on the number of employees, generally between 10 and 250 to 500, depending on the country in which the business is set up. All SMALL & MEDIUM BUSINESS (SMB) share common characteristics regardless of industry and local markets.
Dependence on Few Employees
Many SMALL & MEDIUM BUSINESS (SMB) companies are quite small and have only a very few employees. This limited staff is required to complete all necessary tasks including innovation, production, marketing, sales and accounting for the entire business; for example, the owner of the business may also be the manager who oversees all the areas of the company. This can be a disadvantage if employees do not have the required skill sets to perform multiple tasks well; however, this type of business structure promotes long-term stability rather than focusing on short-term results.
Investing on a dedicated employee just to manage their minimal IT requirements would add a considerable cost to the overall profitability workings. To minimize and support such organizations to reduce such cost, we at CALLEM have come out with a new innovative and cost effective methods to manage all you IT requirements without compromising on the service level and technical aspects.

Our obedience training includes: 

• Socialisation -  With people, cars, noise

    Cembre Cable Lug Size: 35mm X 10mm, Copper Tube Crimping Lugs A-M
A-M series lugs are manufactured from electrolytic copper tube.

 

The dimensions of the tube are designed to obtain the most efficient electrical conductivity and mechanical strength to resist vibration and pull out.

 

Cembre lugs are annealed to guarantee optimum ductility which is an absolute necessity for connectors which will have to withstand the severe deformation arising when compressed and any bending of the palm during installation. 

 

In applications subject to vibration, lugs still have to provide a reliable connection and annealing plays a vital role in avoiding cracking or breaks between the barrel and palm. 

 

The presence of an inspection hole facilitates full insertion of the conductor, whilst the barrel length has been designed to allow easy and accurate positioning of the dies during the crimping operation. Lugs are electrolytically tinplated to avoid oxidation.

A-M series lugs form an important part of Cembre crimping systems for power carrying conductors. Our technicians are always available to provide any technical advice which may be required.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on.

Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Examples of one of scopes of cargo inspection descriptions
CONTAINER INSPECTION - CARGO VERIFICATION - VESSEL SURVEY
Cargo inspectors and/or surveyors examine cargo description from shipping documents and select containers or vessels, ships to inspect, before delivery. These inspectors or surveyors then ensure that the cargo matches the description in the documentation as such specification of cargoes. When wrongly rated cargoes/containers or vessels, ships are identify and found in unsuitable condition and different from/to indented use, the consultancies of inspectors and surveyors to concerning parties to implement Corrective Actions amount and hold the containers, vessels or ships  until the correct corrective actions implemented appropriately. This service helps provide a level playing field for all customers. An executive from a major ocean carrier remarked that ""cargo inspection services are worth to saves the trade millions of dollars""
CARGO MEASUREMENT
Cargo Inspectors and surveyors measure cargoes for accurate dimensions (specifications about raw material, packaging, cargoes). The aim is to provide a neutral measurement result that all concerning parties can agree on. These inspectors usually sampling of cargoes to test quality and items at a standard laboratory before the vessel loads, unloads and report the results to the carrier for their follow-up.
CARGO QUALITY CONTROL AT DESTINATION
Cargo Quality Control plays a more important role which may not be discharged if there is any damage, or import control on your  suppliers. Our inspectors would assure that the quality and count ordered by you is arriving safely in the port of discharge. After approval is received by local authorities we would open your vessel, container, check its contents for quantity, size and quality, and if everything is in line with your order the container will be released to the final destination. If your suppliers did not follow your instructions we would hold the container pending your further instructions.
INSURANCE CARGO SURVEY
We also provide cargo surveys relating to damages occurring during transportation. Our principals here include insurance companies, underwriters and P&I Clubs. In these surveys we analyse the cause of the damage as well as the liability, extent of damage &/or loss. Particular attention is also given to the packing condition and stowage in containers, vessel’s holds. 
Other services offered include investigation of theft, recovery actions where applicable, estimated and damage evaluation for yachts and other boats, and finally the act of loss-prevention, meaning a pre-shipment assistance or attendance with the aim to reduce losses and damages.

Back in 1994, since it was established, the core value of Hitec was serving each customer as if he is the only existing customer, so serving customers properly is embedded in the genes of Hitec staff.
Hitec expanded its operation network in 2004 when AMS (Alternative Machinery Solutions) was established in Dubai to serve the GCC countries and it was the start of the international network for Hitec, few years later, Hitec Saudi was established to serve the biggest and fastest growing economy in the Middle East.
 
Hitec group now is serving around 1500 customers in more than 30 countries.
Since Hitec started, one of its most important competitive advantages is the highly technical skills for Hitec staff, that resulted in the high quality training performed to customers then this training know-how was developed in “Hitec training center” where basic and advanced technical training courses are professionally arranged for dedicated market segments.
 
It was in 2009 when Hitec oil and gas was established to serve this huge segment in the Middle East. Some of Hitec’s best staff was shifted for this business so the core values were automatically transferred to this new business.

BENEFIT OF OMNI CANOLA OIL
With fitness craze taking over the whole world, everyone is looking for healthier replacements for their current dietary habits. Canola oil is one of the considered replacements for your regular refined oil. 

What Is Canola Oil?

Canola oil is retrieved from the crushed seeds of the Canola plant, which is a part of the Brassica family. Vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli are also part of the same family of plants. Canola plants grow between three to six feet, producing fragrant, pretty, bright yellow flowers. Seeds from mature Canola plants are crushed to extract the oil which is then refined, bottled and sold as oil for external use as well as consumption.

The oil from the Canola plant is extremely beneficial for health as it contains the least amount of saturated fat and no trans-fat or cholesterol, making it the healthiest cooking oil among its peers. Canola oil is rich in monounsaturated fat, reducing the risk of coronary disease and a rich source of omega-6 fatty acid, essential for growth and development of the brain in individuals. It is also a rich source of omega-3 fatty acid that protects the body against strokes and heart attacks. Clinical trials and studies reveal that consuming Canola oil instead of other cooking oils impacts the body favourably and offer the individual significant health improvements and increased metabolism.


1. Healthy oil:

2. Happy Heart

3. Lowers Cholesterol

4. Reduces Inflammation

5. Skin Problem

6.Prevent Hair Fall

7.Gets Rid Of Dandruff



The oil is pale golden in color, is not viscous and has a light texture. The oil has high tolerance to heat. It has a neutral taste. Canola oil can be used as a base for salad dressing, sauté-ing, and as a cooking oil instead of groundnut, olive or sunflower oil. Since the oil has a high heat tolerance property, it can be used for baking, stir-frying, grilling and deep-frying ingredients.

Incorporate Omni Canola oil into your daily routine to experience a favourable impact on your health, hair, skin and metabolism for happier and healthier living.
